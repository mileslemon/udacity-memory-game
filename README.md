# Udacity Project: Memory Game

The final project for the second section of the Udacity Front End Web Developer Nanodegree. The outcome of this project is a simple 4x4 memory matching game. We were given initial start code which including a basic HTML template and some basic styles. We were tasked with implementing the functionality for the game with vanilla JavaScript and to add our own styles.
